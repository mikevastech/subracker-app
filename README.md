# The idea of the app
[The idea](https://mikevastech.medium.com/open-source-startup-part-1-the-idea-579457249f0f) is really simple, Subracker, should serve as a boosted reminder for your recurrent transactions, for example, your monthly bills, gym membership, Netflix or Spotify subscriptions, etc. The idea is that it should help you keep track of your recurrent transactions( subscriptions), and show you some advanced analytics on where, when, and how you spend your money. Furthermore, this app will have *NLP* implemented, so, for example, you will be able to quickly add a new recurrent transaction by just typing a few words.
